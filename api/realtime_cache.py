# STRETCH GOAL: Real-Time "Hot Path" Service
# ---
# This file is the placeholder for our "hotline" services.
# In a future iteration, this file would contain the logic for:
#
# 1. A Kafka Consumer:
#    - Connects to the 'ticks' topic in parallel to ClickHouse.
#
# 2. An In-Memory Order Book (using a Segment Tree or dict):
#    - Processes 'quote' or 'book' events.
#    - Provides functions like `get_book_depth(symbol)` that can
#      answer queries in sub-milliseconds without touching the database.
#
# 3. An In-Memory Arbitrage Graph (using networkx):
#    - Processes 'trade' events for FX/Crypto pairs.
#    - Updates edge weights (-log(price)) in a graph.
#    - Runs Bellman-Ford to detect negative-weight cycles (arbitrage).
#
# The `api/main.py` file would then be updated to call functions
# from this module for its `/realtime/*` endpoints.
